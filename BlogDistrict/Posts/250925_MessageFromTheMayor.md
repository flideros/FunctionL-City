# 🏛️ Message from the Mayor: Founding FunctionaL City

Welcome, readers, remixers, and future citizens. This is the inaugural dispatch from the mayor’s desk—a proclamation of intent, stewardship, and civic-native infrastructure. FunctionaL City is not just a codebase. It’s a living, narratable system where every ordinance, overlay, and artifact is inspectable and legacy-worthy.

## 🌆 Why FunctionaL City Exists

FunctionaL City is the belief that code should be treated as civic infrastructure. When a city is formed, its laws and ordinances create a hierarchy of information that is both narrative and traceable. We have garbage collection in our neighborhoods because the city council enacted a law, commissioned engineering studies, built the infrastructure, and offered the service to its citizens. Before the ordinance was passed, planners and engineers studied the problem and documented their findings for the council to consider. These workflows come from my decades as a civil engineer—and they are the foundation I bring to FunctionaL City.

## 🧮 District Dispatch: CivicAlgebraInfrastructure

The first district, *CivicAlgebraInfrastructure*, is my humble attempt to build a set of domain models, implementations, and services that serve as an abstract mathematical data model for any scenario. The guiding principle is symbolic modeling first—everything can be represented symbolically and only calculated at the end.

The Foundations parcel is where the first civic structures are erected. The initial structure, [**FirstOrderLogic.fs**](../../CivicAlgebraicInfrastructure/Foundations/FirstOrderLogic.fs), establishes the symbolic grammar—terms, predicates, quantifiers, and connectives—that other districts will inherit. It’s the ordinance book for symbolic reasoning, built to preserve inspectability, remix rights, and sovereign substitution. you can read more in [**FirstOrderLogic.md**](../../CivicAlgebraicInfrastructure/Foundations/FirstOrderLogic.md)

Next, the parcel will welcome CivicSets.fs, a structure for modeling membership, containment, and symbolic unions. Then Functions.fs, where mappings, dispatchers, and overlays will be defined. From these foundational structures, higher-order types and logical partitions will rise—each narratable, lawful, and legacy-worthy.

## 📣 Call to Remixers

FunctionaL City is yours to remix. Propose ordinances. Draft overlays. Narrate your own districts. Whether you’re extending formula grammar or submitting a tentative map for your own district, your acts are civic, inspectable, and sovereign.

Let this blog be the first of many mayoral dispatches. The city is alive. The charter is open. The remix begins.
