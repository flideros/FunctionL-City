# 🏙️ FunctionaL City: A Civic Infrastructure for Modular Computing

Welcome to **FunctionaL City**—a narratable community of code and random musings where every project is a district, every module an ordinance, and every interface a civic event. This README serves as your **City Charter**, guiding remixers, engineers, and citizens through the founding principles, parcel maps, and symbolic ordinances of the city.

### 📣 Message from the Mayor

FunctionaL City is a living infrastructure project—built from a civil engineer's perspective, with deep care for clarity, modularity, and legacy. While much of this README speaks in metaphor, this message is plain:

>This repository is a technical foundation for real workflows. It’s designed to be inspectable, remixable, and educational. 

Whether you're here to contribute, audit, or adapt it for your own civic stack, you're welcome.FunctionaL City is here to help—not to confuse. If something feels unclear, open an issue. If something feels inspiring, fork it and build your own district.

Thanks for visiting. Let’s build something narratable together.

— Frank L., Mayor of FunctionaL City
