# Civic Algebraic Infrastructure District

**Subdivision of FunctionaL City**  
**Folder:** `CivicAlgebraInfrastructure/`  

---

## Preamble
The **Civic Algebra Infrastructure** provides the city’s **algebraic utilities**—a common foundation in symbolic mathematics that equips remixers to build, extend, and reason about projects across FunctionaL City in a consistent and lawful way. Here, the lawful grammar of algebraic and logical reasoning is established.  
Every ordinance in this district is designed to be:
- **Inspectable** — remixers can trace every symbol and connective.  
- **Narratable** — ordinances are documented as signage charters.  
- **Legacy‑worthy** — revisions are preserved as part of the civic record.  

---

## Purpose
- Provide **core algebraic and logical ordinances** for the city.  
- Establish **formal grammars** for terms, formulas, and connectives.  
- Serve as the **bedrock** for higher‑order extensions (HOL, Modal, Algebraic overlays).  
- Enable remixers to extend, adapt, and reinterpret ordinances while preserving hygiene.

## District Layout

### 1. Foundations
- **Folder:** [`Foundations/`](Foundations/)  
- **Scope:** Core ordinance books for logic and algebra.  
- **Current Ordinances:**  
  - [First Order Logic (FOL)](Foundations/FirstOrderLogic.md) — defines terms, formulas, connectives, and quantifiers.  
  - [Civic Set](Foundations/CivicSet.md) — defines lawful set membership, civic-native extensionality, and signage-style comprehension.
---

## Companion Ordinances
Each ordinance book in this district includes:
- **Code (`.fs`)** — executable civic law.  
- **Case Law (`.fsx`)** — interactive precedents and worked examples.  
- **README (`.md`)** — signage charter explaining scope, purpose, and remix rights.
